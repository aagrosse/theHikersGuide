# The Hikers Guide

### Description
This is a hiker's trail application created using the Hiking Project Data API. This was a collabortive project, and, therefore, a huge learning experience. We went into this project with the intent to create a mobile friendly application that is interactive and includes three Server-Side APIs (OpenWeather Map, LocationIQ, and Hiking Project) and one Third-Party API (bideo.js).  

### Installation
Clone to your local machine and open in your favorite code editor to check it out! Or, visit the deployed version at: 

### Technologies Utilized
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Materialize
* JavaScript
* jQuery

### Notes
We started building this application in an effort to achieve a minimum viable product (MVP). To that end, we hope to achieve some future dated development ideas that will enhance the user engagement with the application.
