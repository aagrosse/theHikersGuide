# The Hikers Guide

### Description

This is a hiker's trail application created using the Hiking Project Data API. This was a collaborative project, and, therefore, a huge learning experience. We went into this project with the intent to create a mobile friendly application that is interactive and includes three Server-Side APIs (OpenWeather Map, LocationIQ, and Hiking Project) and one Third-Party API (bideo.js). 

### Installation

To run the application locally, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine and open in your favorite code editor to check it out!

HTTPS:

`$ git clone https://aagrosse.github.io/theHikersGuide/`

SSH:

### Notes

We started building this application in an effort to achieve a minimum viable product (MVP). To that end, we hope to achieve some future dated development ideas that will enhance the user engagement with the application.
